# Habittracker
## Description 
  A habit tracker project is a web application that allows users to sign in and sign out. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on their habits, such as adding new habits, viewing their existing habits, updating or editing habits, and deleting habits. The project is built using a tech stack consisting of Node.js for the server-side scripting, Express for handling HTTP requests and routing, MongoDB for storing and managing the data, and EJS for rendering the views and templates.
